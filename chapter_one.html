<p>In the palace of Eslarthia, the king was throwing a feast for the entire palace. All generals, captains, noblemen, and wives have been invited.
<br><br>
"Let us celebrate the victory over the kingdom of Ilratheino! We now have control over our entire continent. Let our reign last for generations to come!" The king shouted, raising his glass, and everyone joined in. 
<br><br>
The feast commenced, and everyone was enjoying themselves.
<br><br>
The lords and ladies talked to each other about how their family was of great help to the war. The generals reviewed more war strategies, and the royal family was content. Sadly, this happiness couldn't last long. 
<br><br>
Everyone stopped eating and talking because they heard strangled breathing and gurgling. They looked down the long table to see the king's right-hand man holding his neck, barely breathing. A few seconds later, he died. Medics arrived as fast as they could and examined him to see how he died. When they had finished, their only conclusion was that he'd had something contaminated. Nothing was blocking his airway, and he had no severe allergies, so poison was the only possible solution. 
<br><br>
The king ended the feast immediately and told everyone to be on high alert in case anything like this should happen again.

    <br>
The royal family went to the throne room with his generals to discuss what to do next. They were all still in shock at what happened back at the feast but were determined to stop whatever was happening. 
<br><br>
"The problem is that we don't have any idea who poisoned General Carlos." one of the generals said. 
<br><br>
"Very true. We need to get to the bottom of this, no matter what. Olivia, I want you to round up the best scholars in the kingdom and investigate this further." King Darius commanded. 
<br><br>
"Of course, father," Olivia replied.
<br><br>
"Captain Adrien and Max, I want you two to round up the guards. Train them as hard as possible so that when Olivia finds out who poisoned General Carlos, the guard will be ready to hunt them down." 
<br><br>
"Yes, your majesty." Captain Adrien answered, and Miles, the crowned prince, nodded in agreement. 
<br><br>
"Donovan, I want you to go and research all you can about the available poisons in the kingdom. That would be greatly appreciated. Also, could you be able to make a few antidotes for those poisons as well? We don't want another incident to happen." The king asks his youngest son.
<br><br>
"Absolutely."
<br><br>
"Thank you. And Jake, I want you to help me with the political aspect of this matter. We don't want the kingdom freaking out about this. We need to make sure that the kingdom knows about the danger that this person possesses, but we also need them to not panic about this."
<br>

<br>
And so, that's what everyone did. After the meeting was over, the king's children immediately went to their tasks at hand. Olivia went to the scholars' wing to see what they could find out about the poison. Captain Adrien and Miles went to the barracks and trained them from dawn to dusk. Donovan went to his study, where he kept most of his experiments on poisons and all of those things. He requested that his sister bring him a sample of General Carlos's blood to see which poison was used. And Jake, King Darius, Queen Fiona, and the rest of the Generals worked on how they would present this news to the kingdom.
