<h1>Chapter Fifteen</h1>
<img src="Eslarthia Castle.jpg" width="500">
         <p>A week later, it was the day of the execution.  <br><br>

Miles has been training the five of them nonstop to make sure that they are ready for this. Mainly because the prisoner would be given a sword. <br><br>

Miles also made sure that they all would be wearing armour, especially Olivia.  <br><br>

They had armour and weapons specially made for them, courtesy of Scarlet’s father.  <br><br>

Jake had gotten the word out to the kingdom about the execution, and when the five of them and the guard went to clean up the mess from the battle, all they heard was cheers and clapping, congratulating them for their victory.
 <br><br>

The five of them are walking towards the barracks to get their weapons and armour. 
 <br><br>
“You four ready for revenge?” Miles asks them. 
 <br><br>
“One hundred percent. If I’m being honest, I was jealous that the four of you got to have a go at the murderer and I didn’t.” Jake says.
 <br><br>
“When were you not jealous of your older siblings?” Olivia teases, slinging an arm around his shoulder.
 <br><br>
“Shut up.” Jake responds, shoving her off of him. 

 <br><br>
Once the group gets there, they grab their armour and their weapons and split off. 
 <br><br>
For the execution, they each were assigned one colour. Miles is black, and Jake is navy blue. Since all of the Ambrose house colours have been taken- because the king and queen don’t want to make someone gold or silver since it would be too shiny- Olivia is purple. She doesn’t mind, since purple is her favourite colour. 
 <br><br>
Olivia donned her armour, amethysts embedded into the metal. She even had a custom sword made for her, and it was definitely her favourite sword out of the ones that she has. It was a two handed sword, the metal flexible, but not so that it would break. The hilt was wrapped in sparkly deep purple fabric. The guard had amethysts embedded into it as well, along with a large amethyst in the centre of the pommel. The blade also had a purple-ish tint to it, completing the whole look. She was also given a bow and arrow, and a shield that was also embedded with amethysts. 
 <br><br>
For everyone else, it was pretty much the same, just with different colours. Miles looked like he belonged to the night with the amount of black on his armour and weapons embedded with obsidian and onyx. Jake came out with his navy blue armour and weapons embedded with sapphires, looking like an actual guardsmen, instead of his usual political self. Scarlet, as usual, was donned in red. With her scarlet red armour and weapons embedded with rubies and garnets, she looked like she was born from a flame. Emerson had dark green armour and weapons embedded with emeralds.
 <br><br>
The five of them practised for a little while, as they were waiting to be called on. Eventually, a page came running to the barracks.
 <br><br>
“They are ready for you, your majesties.” he says, bowing slightly, then taking off again. 
 <br><br>
The five of them share a glance, nod, then take off towards the arena. 

 <br><br><br>
Turns out that practically the entire kingdom decided to show up. As the group approached, they could hear the noise that was resonating from the place. They made their way to the gate that leads to the chamber that they would be emerging from, weapons in hand. 
 <br><br>
The guard by the gate let them in, then closed it behind them. 
 <br><br>
A few moments after they had arrived, they heard the speakers turn on.
 <br><br>
“Ladies and gentleman! Thank you for coming! Thankfully, we haven’t had to do this for a long time, but with the troubles that this person has given us, we have no choice.” the king’s voice echoed throughout the stadium.
 <br><br>
“Bring him in!”
 <br><br>
They watch through the bars and see that the prisoner had been shoved into the centre of the arena, the guards closing the gates behind him, removing any access out of the place. He had his head held high, not caring that he’s being sentenced to death at the moment.
 <br><br>
“Demetri Valdarus! You have snuck into the palace without consent. You have stolen moonshadow poison from us. You sent about eighteen innocent citizens of this kingdom to their death by your little stunt that you pulled recently and seriously injured my daughter. You have killed many generals, and worst of all, my son. You have committed many crimes against this kingdom, and you will serve your punishment. After discussing this with King Felix, Queen Rosie, and Queen Fiona, we have all agreed that you will be sentenced to death. Do you have any final words before we release the executioners?”
 <br><br>
“Long live the time when Ilratheino stood alone!” the prisoner shouts. 
 <br><br>
“Release the executioners!”
 <br><br>
The prisoner was tossed a sword, then the gates in front of the group raised, and the five of them stepped onto the field. Gasps were heard among the crowd when they saw the three children of the royal family and their fiancés step out. Most of them were because they thought that the king and queen were insane for putting their children in the middle of another fight, especially when their daughter was still injured, but the other knew that they wanted to avenge their late brother. Some wondered why the Whitlock family allowed their son there, but didn’t question it too much. And then a small portion wondered why Scarlet was there. Sure she’s the daughter of the most famous blacksmith in the kingdom and Miles’s fiancé, but they didn’t know that she could fight. 
 <br><br>
One thing’s for sure, they looked like they were going to tear the prisoner apart. With them donning different colours, they looked like they were a band of very skilled duelists that were ready for battle 24/7. Each of them unsheathed their swords from the scabbard that hung on their belts and took their positions. 
 <br><br>
The prisoner took his position as well, looking slightly less confident than before. 
 <br><br>
The group heard the king shouting that the battle could commence, and they did just that. 
 <br><br>
As a precursor, everyone stood behind Olivia as she fired a dozen arrows at the prisoner with scarily good aim. He deflected about three quarters of the arrows with his sword, but two of them impaled his left thigh, and the other hit his hip.
 <br><br>
After the arrows were fired, the five of them closed in on the prisoner. They slashed and stabbed at him, showing no mercy, unlike before. 
 <br><br>
The prisoner was surprisingly good at sword fighting, but not good enough. He’d managed to re-stab the wound on Olivia’s hip, but in return, he got a jab in the arm. The others had also taken some blows, but nothing compared to what they had given him. 
 <br><br>
The prisoner is currently bleeding from his leg, hip, arm, gut, and he also has a small gash on his head. 
 <br><br>
After about ten minutes, they were pretty much just torturing the guy. They wanted him to feel the pain that they felt when they had Donovan taken away from them. They finally decided to end it, so Miles decapitated him.
