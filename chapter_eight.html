<h1>Chapter Eight</h1>

<p>The next few days were in a hurry to prepare everything for the ball. Servants were running around all over the place to grab the needed materials. Chefs ask the king to confirm the menu for the ball, then re-confirm it, again and again. It’s hectic in the palace. <br><br>

Queen Fiona and Princess Olivia have spent the last three days picking the perfect outfits for the ball. Given that Olivia’s engagement to Prince Emerson will be announced that night, she must look perfect. The two of them settled on wearing dresses that represent their family's colours. Black, gold, silver and navy blue. <br><br>

Queen Fiona would wear a black, strapless dress that fades into gold, while Olivia would wear a navy blue dress that fades into silver closer to the bottom of the dress. Her dress itself is a dress that hugs her bodice, but flows elegantly from her waist. The shoulders of her dress are single pieces of translucent fabric that wrap around her shoulders, not on top. The dress also has ruffles extending from her right hip down to the bottom left corner. <br><br>

She pulled out the fanciest pair of heels that she could find, and the prettiest necklaces. <br><br>

When she walks through those ballroom doors tonight, all of the eyes will be on her. <br><br>

About two hours after noon on the day of the ball, her father needed her to check on her brother to see if he had an idea on the girl he would be choosing.<br><br>

She made her way towards the training grounds, given that that’s where her brother typically is. She had a slight feeling that he would choose the blacksmith’s daughter, since she’s seen how he looked at her whenever her father would invite them over for dinner. Her suspicions were confirmed when she rounded the corner to reveal her brother kissing her. Thankfully for him, none of the guards were out then, so they wouldn’t have to see that. Which is probably why he was doing that. <br><br>

She decided to spare her eyes and left immediately. <br><br>

When she reached the level where her room is located, she saw Emerson approaching her.<br><br>
 
“What’s up?” she asks him when he gets close enough to hear her.<br><br>

“Nothing much. How are you feeling about the fact that after tonight, you’re going to be engaged to me?” <br><br>

“Don’t know. Why?” she shrugs.<br><br>

“You do realise that once we’re engaged, our parents are going to go full hustle on our wedding, right?” he points out.<br><br>

“They’ll most likely put my brother’s wedding in front of ours. Then again, I wouldn’t be surprised if they planned ours simultaneously.” Olivia chuckles. “Well, I should probably start getting ready for the ball.”<br><br>

“Already? That's like in what? Four hours?” <br><br>

“Yeah, well, my mother still wants to go over my outfit, I have to get a massage before because my parents say ‘it helps you dance better’. I need to get my nails done. My hair takes a while-”<br><br>

“Okay, I get it. You have a lot to do. You should probably get started then.” Emerson interrupts, letting Olivia go.<br><br>

And Olivia did precisely as she said she needed to do. Her mother booked her an hour massage to loosen her up for the dance. After that, she joined her mother who had some final touches to add to the dress. Once that was done, she headed to the salon to get her nails done. Even though she would be wearing heels that covered her toes, her mother insisted that she get them done. Her nails were painted sparkly silver with rhinestones added to match her dress. Before she knew it, she needed to get ready for the dance, since it was an hour away. <br><br>
    
Olivia slipped into her dress, getting her maids to zip up the back. They then applied about ten pounds of make-up on her face, covering imperfections and making her look like a true princess. She put on the same necklace that she wore with her pastel pink outfit. Her maids did her hair up into a half up braid crown, accenting her hair with gems and rhinestones. They place a silver crown with white and clear crystals and a large crescent moon on her head to tie the outfit together. Eventually, it was time to join her family to enter the ball. <br><br>

She headed down to the throne room to meet up with her family. She entered the room, and stood beside her mother. The Whitlock family is also in the throne room, waiting to enter the ball. They enter the ballroom first to show a look of power. The Ambrose family followed shortly after. <br><br>

The second those large doors opened, all eyes were on them. More like all eyes were on the Prince and Princess. All the girls were hoping to land Prince Miles, and all the boys were hoping to win over Princess Olivia. In vain, of course. Princess Olivia was already taken. <br><br>

The royal families took their places beside each other, and once again, Olivia and Emerson were beside each other. Everyone else followed their lead, sitting around the large circular tables. <br><br>

“You ready to propose tonight?” Olivia whispers to Emerson.<br><br>

“My parents have made me run this over in my head about a million times. I have to be ready. You look amazing, by the way.” <br><br>

“Thanks.”<br><br>

That’s when the loud voice of Olivia’s father interrupted all of the chatter in the ballroom. <br><br>

“Thank you all for coming to this ball, bringing back an old family tradition. I wish everyone here good luck with their chances. Now, let us eat!”<br><br>

And one by one, the waiters and waitresses file into the ballroom, plates balanced precariously on their arms. <br><br>

Once the five course meal was over, that’s when the absolute ball commenced. As per tradition, the royal family would open the dance. King Darius and Queen Fiona partnered up, and King Felix and Queen Isabella partnered. And Prince Emerson and Princess Olivia partnered up to show a connection between the two families and to signal that they would be engaged later that night. The thing was that everyone expected it when the Whitlock family entered the ball, and the guys were still hanging onto their chances with the Princess. <br><br>

The question remained, who would Prince Miles’s partner be? <br><br>

As Olivia expected, Miles walked up to the girl she remembers as Scarlet Cyprus, and asked her to dance, much to people’s surprise, mostly the girls who were devastated that he didn’t choose them. One thing that her parents made sure they told him was that he needed to dance with at least the top ten girls in the kingdom, not to seem like he hadn't already chosen. <br><br>

The four couples danced across the dance floor, shocking everyone at these people's dancing ability. Scarlet surprised both of the royal families on her ability to dance. She was practically meant to be a Queen. She had the patience that every queen needs, the elegance, the looks, the manners, and the dance skills. It looks like Olivia’s brother chose the best. <br><br>

After about one round of dancing, the rest of the people joined. Olivia and Miles had to rotate on who they danced with, giving many people a false sense of hope, making them think that they have a chance. The Ambrose family still doesn’t understand how people didn’t know that Olivia would be engaged to Prince Emerson at the end of this night. When people heard about the family tradition returning, they thought it would involve both twins. Little did they know that it’s only for the oldest. <br><br>

Eventually, it became the time that the engagements would be announced. All attention was on Prince Miles, and who he would choose. Miles had arranged that he would marry Scarlet Cyprus. He already talked to his parents about it, and they approved. Miles even spoke to her father and Charles said yes. He told her that he chose her this morning, and ultimately, she was overjoyed. Now, all he needed to do was tell that to the kingdom. <br><br>

He walked down the steps that raised the royal families a little higher than everyone else, and made his way down to the girls practically mooning over him. He walks up to Scarlet, gets down on one knee, and makes his statement. <br><br>

“Scarlet Cyprus, daughter of Charles and Maya Cyprus. I, Miles Ambrose, son of King Darius and Queen Fiona Ambrose, pledge to you for the rest of my life. Do you accept my offer to be my bride?”<br><br>

“Yes! Yes! I pledge myself to you for the rest of my life, Miles Ambrose, son of King Darius, and Queen Foina Ambrose.” she cries, almost in tears.<br><br>

A goofy grin spreads across Miles’s face as he places the ring on her finger, kissing her in front of all of the girls that were giving Scarlet death stares, not caring. <br><br>

Miles pulls away, and the two stand beside the royal family, officially together. <br><br>

Once Miles’s proposal is done, all eyes turn to Olivia. All of the boys were looking to see who she would choose. Then much to everyone’s surprise, Prince Emerson walks towards her. He also gets down on one knee before her, and makes his pledge.<br><br>

“Princess Olivia, daughter of King Darius and Queen Fiona. I, Prince Emerson Whitlock, son of King Felix and Queen Isabella Whitlock, from the kingdom of Ilratheino pledge myself to you for the rest of my life. Do you accept my offer to be my bride?” Prince Emerson asks. All the boys looked at him in shock, angry that they didn’t have a chance. The Whitlock family looked proud, and the Ambrose family looked excited. <br><br>

“Yes! I pledge myself to you for the rest of my life, Prince Emerson Whitlock, son of King Felix and Queen Roise Whitlock.” Olivia responds happily. <br><br>

Prince Emerson slides a silver ring with diamonds, accented with silver leaves. After that, he gets up, and they share their first kiss. <br><br>

Everyone applauds, only because they’re pretty much obligated to do so. And as per tradition, the newly engaged couple, or couples in for this matter, dance together. <br><br>

Miles escorts Scarlet to the dance floor, and Emerson escorts Olivia. The two couples dance together, perfectly mirroring each other. Everyone looked at the two of them in awe. The two couples looked like the spitting image of perfection. Miles and Scarlet represent the unity between the royal family and the kingdom, and Emerson and Olivia represent the unity between two realms. Miles in his uniform with the black and gold of the royal family, and Scarlet with her red and gold, representing her job, name, and family colours. Emerson with the colours of his family, black, silver, and red, and Olivia in her navy blue and silver dress, representing the other half of her family. The two couples spinning around the dance floor in perfection.<br>

After the ball, the royal families, and the two couples headed back into the palace to discuss the next phase for each of them. As Olivia expected, her parents immediately started talking about a wedding. It looked like Scarlet was trying to hold in a laugh at her fiancé’s attempts to get his parents to stop. <br><br>

Olivia walks up to her and says,<br><br>

“I promise that they’re not always like this. My parents are just thrilled that my brother finally found someone.”<br><br>

“Can I tell you something?” Scarlet asks her.<br><br>

“Of course.”<br><br>

“If I’m honest, I’ve liked your brother for a long time. Every time my father met with your parents about weapons or something, I would beg to come with him, if it only meant that I could only see your brother. Before today, I thought he would’ve chosen someone else. Not some girl who is the blacksmith’s daughter.”<br><br>

“Trust me when I say this, he’s liked you much longer than you think. Every time you two would leave after a meeting, he would always ask father when they would return. He would talk to me about how pretty you are, and how much he liked you. So if anything, he’s lucky that you said yes.”<br><br>

“It’s Olivia, right?”<br><br>

“The one and only.”<br><br>

“Friends?”<br><br>

“Of course.”<br><br>

Finally, Miles managed to stop the king and queen from going on and on about a wedding for the two of them, but sadly, it changed into them planning a wedding for Olivia and Emerson. <br><br>

“A royal wedding. If it’s okay with you, your majesties, I would like to have the wedding here. We could have doves flying above, a giant-”<br><br>

“Mother! Please, calm down. We don’t need to get into this immediately.” Olivia says.<br><br>

“Nonsense, dear. Now that you and Emerson are engaged, we need to get started on your wedding immediately. It will be the unity between the two kingdoms, securing peace between us once and for all.”<br><br>

“Please, mother. Can we talk about this tomorrow? It’s been a long night, and I’m exhausted.”<br><br>

“Very well,” Queen Fiona sighs. “We will continue this tomorrow. And Scarlet, we’ve arranged a room for you, now that you are engaged to Miles. I’m sure he will be willing to show you the way.”<br><br>

“Of course, mother.” Miles responds, leading Scarlet out of the throne room.<br><br>

Olivia and Emerson also walk out of the room, arm in arm.<br><br>

“Well, tonight was interesting.” Emerson says to her as they’re walking down the halls. <br><br>

“Yeah. I never knew our first kiss would be before the entire kingdom.” <br><br>

“It needed to happen at some point, though.”<br><br>

“True. Well, we’re here. I should probably be heading to bed now. Good night, fiancé.”<br><br>

“Good night.” Emerson responds, giving Olivia a quick peck on her lips. <br><br>

“What was that for, exactly?”<br><br>

“Well, we’re engaged now. Better get used to it.” Emerson smirks, heading to his room.<br><br>
