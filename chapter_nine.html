<h1>Chapter Nine</h1>

<img src="IMG-0098.jpg" width="500">

<p>The entire next day was spent planning two weddings. The king and queen sat both couples down to determine what each wanted in their marriages. Honestly, it was chaos. Letting the king and queen do whatever they wanted, the two couples changed into casual clothing and headed into the kingdom without the escorts and all that fancy stuffâ€”trying to blend in. Both teams eventually ended up leaving because they were tired of it.<br><br>

They ran from street to street as fast as they could. The four stop, gasping for breath in a village a couple of kilometres from the palace. <br><br>

"I've never had so much fun running away in my life. And I've once tried to escape on one of the wagons that transport the food into our palace." Emerson says. <br><br>

"Hey, wait! This is the village that my father lives in." Scarlet tells us. <br><br>

"Come on!" she calls, taking off down one of the roads.<br><br>

The rest of us follow her, trying to keep up with her pace. We eventually stopped at a large blacksmith shop that looked like it could've been around for centuries. <br><br>

"This shop has been in our family for generations. My father and I have kept it running for generations. Hopefully, my brother will return from his post soon to help father run the shop without me." <br><br>

"Who's your brother?" Olivia asks her.<br><br>

"Aiden Cyprus."<br><br>

"I'll see what I can do."<br><br>

"Thank you, Olivia."<br><br>

"Come in. I'm sure my father would love to meet you all." Scarlet says, entering the shop.<br><br>

The three of them exchange a glance, then head in as well.<br><br>

Olivia walks around the room, admiring how much work her family has put into the shop.<br><br>

Everything looks brand new, but keeping with the rustic look of the place. There are weapons of all types hanging on the wall. Suits of armour on stands. Everything that you could ever think of. It was awe-inspiring. <br><br>

"Father! I brought some guests." Scarlet calls.<br><br>

A man with a short black beard, messy black curls and a slightly aged face walks out from the back of the shop. <br><br>

"Ah, Scarlet, honey, give your old man a hug." the man responds, engulfing Scarlet in a bear hug.<br><br>

"Who are your guests?" he asks her.<br><br>

She steps aside to reveal the three of us.<br><br>

"Y-your majesties. I didn't realize that you would be coming today. P-please, look around." he stutters, shocked by their presence.<br><br>

"Please, none of that. Today, we wish only to explore. No royal duties for today." Olivia responds, and the man looks slightly relieved.<br><br> 

"Can I get you guys anything to drink? I'm sure that I have some tea in the back."<br><br>

"No, thank you. We're fine for now."<br><br>

"Of course."<br><br>

After about half an hour of staying at the shop, the four left, deciding to explore more.<br><br>

"Scarlet, you're the expert here. Can you show us around? Show us what it's like to be a normal person?" Miles asks her.<br><br>

"Of course, your majesty. I can teach you how normal people live." Scarlet chuckles.<br><br>

The rest of the day was pretty much Scarlet showing the royals what life was like outside the palace. They ate some meat from a standoff on the street, Scarlet promising that it was delicious, which it was. They explored a school and even read to the children there. They never knew that life outside of the palace was so interesting. <br><br>

"Well, as much as I hate to leave, we better be heading back now. Your parents might start to worry that someone kidnapped you three." Scarlet tells them, earning them all to let out a small laugh. <br><br>

The four slowly return to the palace, reminiscing about the day's events.<br><br>

"Do you remember when Miles tripped simply walking down the street?" Olivia asks, earning a laugh from Emerson and Scarlet while Miles glares at her.<br><br>

"Hey! You were the one who spilled your drink because of a wasp." Miles retorts.<br><br>

"You should've seen the size of that thing! It was huge!"<br><br>

Miles rolls her eyes at her, and they enter the castle. <br><br>

"Where were you four? We were worried sick!" Queen Fiona shouts as soon as they enter.<br><br>

"Relax, mother. We were exploring the kingdom."<br><br>

"Very well, but the next time you do that, at least tell someone in the palace, so we don't have the servants scurrying around the place, looking for you."<br><br>
