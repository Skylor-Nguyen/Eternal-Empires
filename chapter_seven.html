<h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
<img src="Eslarthia Castle.jpg" width="500">    
<p>A few days later, Emerson and Olivia are getting along much better than when Emerson first arrived. Olivia and Emerson still feel like they need to connect better before they announce to the public that they will be engaged, and Miles still hasn’t had the guts to ask Scarlet to marry him. General Adrien and Miles have been training the guard so hard that the second they see the murderer, he will die instantly. And King Darius and Jake have been planning the ball where Miles will choose a girl to marry, and Olivia and Emerson will announce their engagement. Sadly for all three of them, the ball is in a week.<br><br>

Miles is heading down the halls to the barracks, but stops in his tracks when he sees his sister running down the aisles in her usual investigation outfit. She stops in front of him, gasping for breath.<br><br>

“M-Miles. C-come quick. I-It’s urgent.” she tells him between breaths. <br><br>

“Sis, what’s happening.” He asks her, grabbing her shoulders to get her to face him, worried. <br><br>

“Come with me.” she says, grabbing his wrist and taking off down the corridors. <br><br>

The two of them are running down the halls. Miles recognizes the direction they’re heading in, but can’t process where he remembers it from since they’re sprinting at full speed.<br><br>

 “What’s going on!” Miles shouts.<br><br>

“There’s been another murder. Father told me to get you as soon as possible, and thank god that I know your routine, because if not, I would’ve been searching for hours.” Olivia tells him.<br><br>

Eventually, they stop at the edge of a large crowd of people<br><br>

“Move out of the way. It’s Princess Olivia and Prince Miles.” Olivia says while dragging Miles through the crowd of people that are clearing a way for them at the word of Olivia.<br><br>

“Thank god you’re here son. I’m sorry to say this, but General Adrien has passed.” his father says as he and Olivia reach the centre of the crowd.<br><br>

“We believe that the murder is connected to the death of Donovan and General Carlos.” Olivia adds. <br><br>

Miles looks at the body well and realises that what his father is saying is true. General Adrien, Miles’s mentor, his captain, has been murdered by the same person that killed his brother and General Carlos. Anger boils within Miles and swears that whoever did this will die.<br><br>

“We need to have a meeting about this ASAP. Olivia, can you and your crew gather as much evidence about this murder as you can, then meet us in the council chambers. After that, I’ll gather the generals and we’ll figure out what to do moving forward.”<br><br>

“Of course, father.” Olivia says, bowing, then assembling the scholars to start their investigation. <br><br>

“Miles, will you please follow me?” King Darius asks, walking away with Queen Fiona. <br><br>

Miles follows them back to the council chambers. Miles takes his usual seat at the table and looks to his father, looking for why he called him there. <br><br>

“Miles, I know that you were close with General Adrien, so I offer you my sympathy about his death. In his death, the Captain of the Guard position is now open. Now I know that the other generals will be begging to have someone in their family, or even themselves to take up the position, even though they're nowhere near the skill level it takes to be the Captain of the Guard. To prevent this, I will choose the new Captain myself. Even before General Adrien’s murder, I’ve known who I want the new captain to be. Miles, my son, I would like to offer you the new Captain of the Guard position. You have been training under General Adrien since you were a little boy, and no one in this kingdom even meets the skill level you possess. So? Would you like the position?”<br><br>

“Yes, thank you. I’m honoured that you thought of me.” Miles responds. <br><br>

“Of course. I meant everything that I said. And it would be fun to work alongside my son in battle.” <br>

</p>

<p>The entire royal family and the generals are gathered around the large table in the centre of the council chamber, trying to figure out what to do next.<br><br>

“Olivia, what have you found out since the last time we were here?” King Darius asks her. <br><br>

“The most important thing I have found out is that it was the same person that killed Donovan as General Carlos. As for General Adrien, we have discovered that the moonshadow poison also killed him. We discovered the poison in his bloodstream. We rechecked the kitchens to see if more poison was down there and found another bottle. We matched up the fingerprints, and once again, it’s the same person that killed General Adrien as the rest. Whoever this person is is hiding in the kitchens or working there. Father, I highly suggest you allow us to investigate the kitchens and interrogate everyone there. Other than that, I have nothing else to report.” Olivia informs everyone.<br><br> 

“Thank you, Olivia. Now, I know that all of you are wondering who will be the new Captain of the Guard. Before you push yourself to that position, know I have already chosen the person to take up that role. The only person that knows of my decision is me and my family. I will be announcing the new Captain at the ball that’s happening in a few days. If none of you have anything else you would like to say, I declare that this meeting is dismissed.” King Darius announces, and the royal family exits the chambers. <br><br>

“Fiona dear, could you please tell the Whitlock family that we would like to meet with them in fifteen please?” King Darius asks. <br><br>

“Of course.”<br><br>

“Olivia, I do need you to change though. I want you looking your best for this meeting.”<br><br>

“Yes, father.” Olivia says, nodding, then heading to her room. <br><br>

She changed into a pastel pink dress that flowed around her. The sleeves are simply pieces of fabric fluttering on top of her shoulders. She applied some silver eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara. She had her maids do her hair up into a high bun, weaving some jewels into her dark brown hair. She put on a sparkly silver crescent moon necklace with clear crystals at the chain's base, and diamonds embedded into the moon. She slipped into white heels with silver covering the last two inches. Once she knew that she was ready, she exited her room.<br><br> 

She’s walking down the corridor, when suddenly, she feels someone crash into her. She starts falling backwards, but the person grabs her waist, keeping her from hitting the floor.<br><br>

“Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry! I didn’t see you there.” the person says, which she can now make out to be Prince Emerson.<br><br>

“It’s fine. I wasn’t looking where I was going.” Olivia apologises. “I have to go to a meeting now, which I’m pretty sure that you need to get to as well.”<br><br>

“You would be correct. Am I allowed to walk you to the meeting?” <br><br>

“I don’t see why not.”<br><br>

The two of them walk towards the meeting room, arm in arm. <br><br>

“Ah, Prince Emerson, Olivia, I’m so glad that you are able to join us. Please, take your seats.” King Darius says as the two of them walk into the meeting room. <br><br>
 
They take their seats, and the king starts the meeting. <br><br>

“As I’m sure you all know, in three days’ time, we will be throwing a ball to find Prince Miles, a princess. We hope that he will dance with his soon to be bride during this dance. I-”<br><br>

“King Darius, not to be rude, but how do you hope that your son will dance with some girl have anything to do with us?” King Felix asks.<br><br>

“We all know that my daughter, Princess Olivia, and your son, Prince Emerson, will be engaged soon. As my son dancing with this girl will show a sign of strength within our kingdom, I think the two of them should dance together to show strength between our two kingdoms. We’re going to announce to the kingdom who our son has chosen to be his bride, and I was hoping we can do the same with our daughter.” King Darius explains.<br><br>

“Of course. One question I have is how will you tell the kingdom that our son is engaged to your daughter?”<br><br>

“Because this ball is bringing back an old family tradition. About five hundred years ago, my long gone grandfather, King Fredrick Ambrose, created the tradition that when a prince comes of age, a huge ball will be held, and he will choose a woman to be his bride. My great grandfather, King Derek, ended the tradition about a century ago, saying that the prince will find his bride when he’s ready. Sure, this created an upset within the kingdom, but they eventually got used to it. But now, since we have a murderer in this kingdom, we need to look strong. And by bringing back this tradition, there will be a union between my son and the person he chooses, and there will be a union between my daughter and your son, which will show power within the kingdom.”<br><br>

And just like that, the Ambrose Twins’ fate was decided for them.<br>
